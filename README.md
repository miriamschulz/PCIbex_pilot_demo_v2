# Pilot demo version2

This directory contains the materials for a basic demo pilot study for C3-WP3.

This is pilot-version-2, in which the frequency manipulated object is presented 2x, not 1x, in each display.
The number of conditions is reduced from 4 to 3, since in condition D, two distractor crates would be identical.
